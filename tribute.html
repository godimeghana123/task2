    <h2 class="ha">Albert Einstein</h2>
    <div>
        <li>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist,widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and
            most influential physicists of all time. </li>
        <li>Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
            the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of
            modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been
            dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
            science.</li>
        <li>He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
            discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His
            intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".
            Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</li>
        <li>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four
            groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion,
            introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of
            classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to
            develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published
            a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the
            general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of
            statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of
            molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which
            laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</li>
        <li>However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors.
            First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that
            "God does not play dice". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his
            geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
            from the mainstream of modern physics.</li>

                    <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March
                        1879 into
                        a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer,
                        and
                        Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob
                        founded
                        Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment
                        based on
                        direct current.

                        Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years.
                        At the
                        age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the
                        Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium),
                        where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German
                        Empire seven
                        years later</p>
                    <p>
                        In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical
                        lighting
                        because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard
                        to the
                        more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich
                        factory. In
                        search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to
                        Pavia.
                        In Pavia, the Einsteins settled in Palazzo Cornazzani, a medieval building where, at different
                        times,
                        Ugo Foscolo, Contardo Ferrini and Ada Negri lived. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein,
                        then 15,
                        stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to
                        pursue
                        electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school's
                        regimen and
                        teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in
                        strict rote
                        learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia,
                        convincing the
                        school to let him go by using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay
                        with the
                        title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".

                <td><p>By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.
                    The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the
                    University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in
                    theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.</p>
                <p>Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911,
                    accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.During his Prague stay, he wrote
                    11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.</p></td>

        <h3 class="ha">Death</h3>
        <p>On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.

            Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."He died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.
            
            During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent.Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.
            
            In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."
        
            Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.</p>
